## Redefines the tempfile template for RAVE.

# Standard python libs:

import tempfile
import stat

# Module/Project:
import rave, rave_defines

## Use shared memory space if available, Linux only.

# @param close string, set to "True" to close the file before continuing.
# The default value is "False".
# @return tuple containing an int containing an OS-level handle to an open
# file as would be returned by os.open(), that can be closed with os.close().,
# and a string containing the absolute pathname to the file.
# NOTE the file is created and opened. In order to prevent too many open files,
# you may have to close this file before continuing.
