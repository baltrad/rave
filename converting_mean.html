<p >During that time several modules have seen life and gone into oblivion.

Other than that, it is quite straight forward implementation and will hopefully be quite easy to translate into the new architecture of rave. It probably has been developed for working with 2-dimensional cartesian products but (as usual), there could be a layer at python-side that converts a scan to a 2-dimensional image as well.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd></dd></dl>

<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>Now, what can we do about the function <b>_average_func</b>? We want to create an cartesian product containing the average values over a NxN square, let's get on with it.</p>

<pre class="fragment">  cartesian = PyCartesian_GetNative((PyCartesian*)pyobject);
</pre><p >This is a bit odd, but all rave-objects are basically a wrapper around a pure c-api, so instead of working through the python object we can access the c-object instead. This might not be true for all api's in the future but in that case, those api's will describe it.</p>
<pre class="fragment">  target = RAVE_OBJECT_CLONE(cartesian);

I.e. it would not have been a good idea to use RAVE_OBJECT_COPY here since we would have modified the same object.</p>
<p >Also, it is time to consider memory management here, since <b>PyCartesian_GetNative</b> returns a reference to the cartesian product with the reference counter increased we need to release this reference when we are leaving the function. This is preferrably done at the end of the function.</p>

<p >We are actually using two identifiers when returning values, first, the RaveValueType, this is an indicator for DATA/NODATA or UNDETECT. Try to use this as much as possible since it gives a better overview.</p>
<p >As it is, we have introduced a new public function into the Cartesian object and it's time to consider have we done everything correctly or have we missed something. It would be awkward if we have done something fundamentally wrong in this function so it probably is worth writing a simple test that at least verifies that we get a mean value from this function. There are two ways, one is to write a small c-main function that does this or we can add a new function to the python api for the cartesian products as well and write unit tests. Unit tests are quite handy since they will be run every time we check in code to our git-server.</p>
